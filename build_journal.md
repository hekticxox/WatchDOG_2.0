how to create me my own personal crypto signal bot. These are the features I want: 1. Nice colorful interface. 2. I want it to use all the most important indicators for ALL TIME FRAMES. 3. I want the calls to be no less then 30 minutes but no more than 4 hours. 4. When the bot makes a prediction, it will estimate the amount of time the call will run and there will be visible on the frontpage until that countdown is finished. 5. The outcome of those predictions will be logged in to the system for the ML and the AI to tweak their configs to make thier predictions more acurate in the future. 6. I want it to not only find profitable long calls but also long shorts. 7. I want the calls to be based off a point system. Major indicators for all time frames will help shape the predictions. There will be points for hitting certin indicators but also for indicators working together. Not only that but it will also add up indicators for the opposite direction and will subtract points depending on the reverse indicators as well. I also want there to be a visual point system showing how many times a coin has been on the board. So example everytime a crypto coin is put on the board as a long call it will get a plus 1 point. every time it goes on as a short call it will get a -1 call. Almost like counting cards in blackjack. The higher the points in ether direction is another indicator on the predictibility of the outcome. More confidience can be gained from seeing a coin have +12 or -12 ect... There will be one entrance script the main script which will have a perminate chart which will have data that will change out every time the market goes through a full scan. Remember once a call is made there is a countown timer for the predicted run and the coin will stay on the board until the timer runs out. I only want a total of 10 coins on this chart at all time. Also for the calls i want it to show how many indicators it has hit as a little indicator but this can be in small text that is different colors for different point values. so for a call it will have the coin name, it will have the estimated timeframe it will run, it will have if the call was a short or a long and it will have the little color-coded indicator legend as well. I want the market scan to be continuously running and really only want to include futures; we will go with the free API that has the most data and the fastest response time with easiest usage. Every time the scan ends it will update the chart however the predicted calls will get their spot until the estimated time runs up. i want you to build it as if it is a professional trader whos job is to inform you have these calls and how long they run in order to guide the user in to trading in confidence. That reminds me there will also be a confidence percentage that can go with each coin that can go up or down after each full market scan. now please instruct me on what programing to use and how to instruct or prompt co pilot to build me the best crypto signal calling bot/repo on the market.

Short summary (stack recommendation)

Frontend: React (TypeScript) + Tailwind CSS + Recharts (or Recharts-like) for charts — colorful, responsive UI.

Backend / Market ingest: Node.js (TypeScript) using ccxt for REST + exchange websockets for live market data. Use exchange websockets for tick/klines where available (far faster & kinder to rate limits). 
GitHub
Binance Developer Center

Exchange choice / data source: Start with Binance (USDT perpetual futures) or Bybit — both have robust public market data and websockets; Binance docs strongly recommend websockets for timeliness and to avoid rate limits. 
Binance Developer Center
Binance
Bybit Exchange

Data bus / realtime: Redis (Pub/Sub) or simple WebSocket server to push signals to frontend.

Storage / logging: PostgreSQL or SQLite for experiment logs + timeseries metadata. Store each prediction record, live outcome, and features used.

ML/AI loop: Small Python microservice (FastAPI) using scikit-learn / LightGBM / PyTorch — trains on logged results, returns tuned weights / thresholds. Connect via HTTP or message queue.

Orchestration: Docker for local development; system runs continuous market scan and emits up to 10 calls active at once.

Important tools: ccxt (exchange library), TA library (technical indicators) — e.g., technicalindicators (npm) or talib-binding; or compute indicators in Python for ML. 
GitHub

Important operational notes (do read)

Use websockets for price/klines whenever possible — it’s lower latency, better rhythm for continuous scans, and prevents hitting REST rate limits. Binance explicitly recommends websockets for market data. 
Binance Developer Center

Exchanges throttle requests — design your scanner to use websockets + sensible aggregator windows (30m minimum calls in your config) to avoid bans. If you must poll, obey rate limits and implement exponential backoff. 
Binance
Bybit Exchange

CCXT is great for a unified exchange interface but some websocket features require CCXT Pro or exchange-native code; use CCXT for REST and exchange SDKs or websocket streams for kline streaming.

High-level architecture (one paragraph)

A Node.js TypeScript backend connects to exchange websockets and collects klines/tick data across multiple timeframes (1m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 4h, etc.). A scanner service aggregates indicators per symbol per timeframe, computes a point score (positive for long, negative for short) using weighted indicator hits and co-occurrence bonuses, then emits signals (predicted direction, estimated run duration, confidence %, indicator-hit counts) to a Redis queue and WebSocket clients. Frontend shows 10 active calls, each with countdown, small color legend, indicator count, confidence, and chart. All predictions and outcomes are logged to Postgres; a Python ML service periodically pulls logs, trains a model to adjust indicator weights and thresholds, then pushes new weights back to the scanner.

How to prompt GitHub Copilot in VS Code — overall strategy

Copilot works best when you give:

File path + role comment at top (e.g., // file: src/scanner/score.ts — compute score function)

Clear input/output types (TypeScript types)

Short examples of the desired behaviour (one or two examples, e.g., symbol A had +12→confidence up)

A focused instruction prompt for each component (frontend card, backend scanner loop, ML trainer).

I’ll give copy-paste prompts for each major file.

Concrete lists: indicators & timeframes

Indicators (major): SMA/EMA, RSI, MACD, ATR, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic %K/%D, OBV, VWAP, ADX, Ichimoku, CCI, Volume spikes, On-Balance Volume. (These should be computed for each timeframe.)
Timeframes: 1m, 3m, 5m, 15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 4h (you asked 30m–4h calls but indicators will use ALL timeframes to inform).
Call durations: Minimum 30 minutes, maximum 4 hours — scanner should round to nearest multiple of 5–15 minutes based on confidence & timeframe alignment.

Data model (prediction record) — simplified
type Prediction = {
  id: string;
  symbol: string;
  direction: 'long'|'short';
  score: number;           // aggregated points
  indicatorsHit: Record<string, number>; // e.g. { 'RSI_1h':1, 'EMA_10_1h':1 }
  indicatorCount: number;  // small display number
  confidence: number;      // 0-100
  estimatedRunMs: number;
  createdAt: string;
  expiresAt: string;       // createdAt + estimatedRun
  finalOutcome?: { pnlPercent: number, closedAt: string }
}

Example Copilot prompts to paste into a new file (backend)

Below are ready prompts you can paste into a new .ts file in VS Code so Copilot can expand them to full implementations. Put the comment header at the top of the file and then start typing the function name — Copilot will suggest implementations.

1) Score function — backend/src/scanner/score.ts

Paste this header and start a function computeScore(...). Copilot will attempt to write the body. I’ve included a base implementation you can also paste in; it’s intentionally compact and clear so Copilot can expand tests around it.

// file: backend/src/scanner/score.ts
// Purpose: compute aggregate point score for symbol across many indicators & timeframes.
// Input: features: { [indicatorAtTimeframe:string]: {value:number, hit:boolean} }
// Output: { score:number, indicatorCount:number, breakdown: Record<string,number> }

/**
 * Example behavior:
 * - For each indicator hit add its base weight.
 * - If several indicators agree in same direction at same timeframe add a co-occurrence bonus.
 * - Subtract points from opposite-direction indicators.
 * - Add +1 / -1 to the "card count" every time a prediction is placed (external incrementer).
 */

export type IndicatorFeature = {
  name: string; // "RSI"
  timeframe: string; // "1h"
  direction: 'long'|'short'|null; // null if neutral
  weight?: number; // optional base weight
  strength?: number; // 0-1 representing how strongly the indicator signals
}

export function computeScore(features: IndicatorFeature[], cardCount: number): {
  score: number;
  indicatorCount: number;
  breakdown: Record<string, number>;
} {
  // Copilot: implement a weighted scoring algorithm:
  // - group by timeframe and direction
  // - sum base weights * strength
  // - if >=3 indicators agree in same timeframe add +bonus
  // - subtract opposite sums
  // - include cardCount as additional prior (each +1 means +0.2 points)
  const breakdown: Record<string, number> = {};
  let score = 0;
  let indicatorCount = 0;

  // naive baseline, Copilot should optimize/expand:
  for (const f of features) {
    const base = (f.weight ?? 1) * (f.strength ?? 1);
    const key = `${f.name}_${f.timeframe}_${f.direction}`;
    breakdown[key] = (breakdown[key] ?? 0) + base;
    if (f.direction === 'long') score += base;
    else if (f.direction === 'short') score -= base;
    if (f.direction) indicatorCount++;
  }

  // co-occurrence bonus:
  const tfDirCounts: Record<string, number> = {};
  for (const k of Object.keys(breakdown)) {
    const parts = k.split('_'); // name_timeframe_direction
    const tf = parts[1], dir = parts[2];
    const k2 = `${tf}_${dir}`;
    tfDirCounts[k2] = (tfDirCounts[k2] ?? 0) + 1;
  }
  for (const k in tfDirCounts) {
    if (tfDirCounts[k] >= 3) {
      // bonus magnitude depends on count
      score += (tfDirCounts[k] - 2) * 0.5 * (k.endsWith('long') ? 1 : -1);
    }
  }

  // include card count (the +1/-1 historical board occurrences)
  score += cardCount * 0.2;

  return { score, indicatorCount, breakdown };
}


If Copilot doesn’t produce extra helpers, use this function as-is and iterate.

2) Scanner loop prompt (backend/src/scanner/index.ts)

Paste this comment and then start async function runScan() — ask Copilot to generate the scheduler that:

collects latest candles for symbol across timeframes (via websocket store or REST fallback),

computes indicators,

calls computeScore,

emits prediction if score passes thresholds,

enforces max 10 active predictions and min 30m / max 4h durations.

Prompt header:

// file: backend/src/scanner/index.ts
// Role: Continuously scan exchange market data, compute features, call computeScore(), and manage active predictions.
// Requirements:
//  - Use websocket candle store if available, fallback to REST for missing history
//  - Only create a prediction if estimated run is between 30m and 4h.
//  - Max 10 active predictions at any time. If slots full, only replace if new confidence > existing lowest.


Include function signature and example use of computeScore; Copilot will expand.

3) Frontend card component prompt (frontend/src/components/PredictionCard.tsx)

Provide this header then start the React component skeleton.

// file: frontend/src/components/PredictionCard.tsx
// Role: Show coin name, direction (long/short), estimated timeframe, small color-coded indicator legend, indicator count, confidence %, and countdown timer.
// Requirements:
//  - Clean colorful UI, Tailwind classes
//  - Small colored chips for indicator counts (green positive, red negative, amber neutral)
//  - shows a mini sparkline for the symbol (use lightweight svg)

Example UI layout & behavior to prompt Copilot for pages

pages/Home.tsx: a grid of up to 10 PredictionCard components, plus left sidebar with scanning status, global confidence heatmap, and “market scan” controls.

Above each card: coin symbol, direction badge, big confidence % circle, small indicator-hits text (color coded), countdown timer in mm:ss until expiry.

Prompt Copilot: “Create a React page that fetches /ws updates, shows up to 10 cards sorted by confidence desc, uses Tailwind for styling.”

ML loop & logging — how to prompt Copilot

Create two files:

backend/src/db/models/prediction.ts — schema for DB storing predictions and final outcome.

ml/trainer/train.py — FastAPI endpoint that pulls labeled records, trains a model to predict success or adjust indicator weights (supervised learning: features → outcome). Use scikit-learn or LightGBM.

Prompt: “Write a FastAPI app that exposes /train which reads new labeled predictions from Postgres, trains a simple LightGBM model, returns feature importances and updated indicator weights as JSON.” (Copilot will scaffold train/predict code).

Point system — display & persistence

Per-symbol history counter: for each symbol have an integer cardCount incremented +1 for long entries and -1 for short entries. Persist in DB. Show it as a small badge on the card (e.g., +12 green, -8 red).

Indicator co-occurrence: When X indicators at same timeframe signal same dir, add a bonus. We already scaffolded that.

Indicator hits display: small text like • 7 hits with color mapping: >=8 => bright green, 4-7 => amber, <4 => grey. Copilot can create CSS/Tailwind helper to map this.

Example "prompt recipe" you can paste into VS Code to instruct Copilot (full sequence)

Copy this block into a new file DEVELOPER_PROMPTS.md and open it; use Copilot to generate each file by copying the related snippet above then invoking Copilot completions.

### Create backend scoring function
// file: backend/src/scanner/score.ts
// Implement computeScore(features, cardCount) as specified below: ...
[then paste the computeScore skeleton above]


Then for each file: paste the comment header and start typing export async function ... or function computeScore — Copilot will suggest code and tests. Be explicit in the comments about constraints (30m–4h durations, max 10 active calls).

Small working example: scoring & decision snippet (paste into Node/TS)

I already gave computeScore. Here’s a small decision snippet to choose an estimated run (30m–4h) based on top timeframes alignment and confidence:

function estimateRunDuration(score: number, timeframesAgreement: string[]): number {
  // score roughly maps to minutes: higher score → longer run
  // base 30 minutes min, cap 4 hours (240 min)
  const base = 30;
  const extra = Math.min(Math.max(score * 10, 0), 210); // score 0->210
  // if multiple higher timeframes (1h/2h/4h) agree, extend duration
  const hf = timeframesAgreement.filter(t => ['1h','2h','4h'].includes(t)).length;
  const hfBonus = hf * 30; // each high timeframe adds 30m
  const total = Math.min(240, base + extra + hfBonus);
  return total * 60 * 1000; // ms
}


Use this as your starting heuristic; Copilot can generate tests and tuning scripts.

Real prompts for Copilot (concrete, ready to paste)

Use these exact lines as the top comment of a new file and then invoke Copilot completions:

// Create a TypeScript function computeScore(features, cardCount) that returns {score, indicatorCount, breakdown}. Use weighted sums, co-occurrence bonuses, and subtract opposite-direction indicators. Provide unit tests.

// Create a scanner module: connect to Binance websocket klines, maintain sliding windows for timeframes [1m,5m,15m,30m,1h,2h,4h], compute indicators, call computeScore(), and emit to Redis for frontend. Include rate limit safe guards and REST fallback.

// Create a React Tailwind component PredictionCard that receives a Prediction object and displays symbol, direction badge, confidence circle, indicatorCount colored label, cardCount badge, and a countdown timer until expiresAt.

// Create a FastAPI ML microservice that pulls predictions with outcomes from Postgres, trains LightGBM to predict win probability, and returns JSON of updated indicator weights and feature importances.

Testing / dev tips

Start with a small symbol set (top 50 futures) — scaling to thousands is a later step.

Simulate latency and test slots (10 active) logic with a fake market feed first.

Keep an audit trail: every prediction logged with the exact indicator values used — that’s required for reliable ML.

Use backtests (historical data) before live trading. The system should inform your trading, not blindly trade in production unless you’ve done heavy testing.

Safety & legal reminder

You asked for a bot that detects “long shorts” and gives trade ideas. I’ve shown how to build a signal generator and ML loop. If you plan to automate live orders, please ensure you comply with exchange terms, risk management, and legal requirements in your jurisdiction. I won’t produce automated order-execution code without explicit confirmation and caution steps.

Final checklist to hand to Copilot (paste these as file headers / prompts)

Scanner: [x] websockets + sliding windows, [x] compute indicators for multi-timeframe, [x] computeScore, [x] enforce 30m–4h, [x] keep max 10 active predictions.

UI: [x] React + Tailwind, [x] PredictionCard, [x] countdown, [x] indicator legend and cardCount badge.

Storage: [x] save prediction start+end+features+final outcome.

ML: [x] Python FastAPI training endpoint, [x] adjust indicator weights, [x] return JSON.

Dev: [x] docker-compose, [x] README with run instructions and sample env variables.

If you want, I can now:

produce a starter repo skeleton (package.json, main TS files, simple React page) as actual code you can paste into VS Code, OR

generate detailed Copilot prompts for each file (even more granular), OR

produce unit tests and a local simulated market feed so you can validate the 10-slot logic and countdown behavior.
